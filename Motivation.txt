Business reasons
1. People don't want to talk to other people anymore. You would rather buy it on Amazon then go to a store. 
2. More people are likely to want to spend less money and get a quick summary of what can be done based on the information they provide.
3. They feel like they are in control, because in a way they are. 

Acoustic reasons
1. Measure noise levels in a space over period of time when we can't phyiscally be there. 
2. Measure impulse response via hand clap when we can't be there

Analysis can be done ANYWHERE. This could be a HUGE deal as many small jobs could be more fun than a small number of large jobs.
